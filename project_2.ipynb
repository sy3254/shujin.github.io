    "# Project 2 \n",
    "# Public Wi-Fi Access Across New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first moved to New York City, one of the hardest adjustments was staying connected on the go without burning through mobile data. The city advertises thousands of public Wi-Fi hotspots, from LinkNYC kiosks to networks in parks and public housing. But are these hotspots spread evenly across the five boroughs, or do some areas have much better access than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use two NYC Open Data datasets to explore **how public Wi-Fi access varies by borough once we adjust for population size**. Instead of just counting hotspots, I calculate **hotspots per 10,000 residents** to make a fair comparison between larger and smaller boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question**\n",
    "\n",
    "> After adjusting for population, which NYC borough has the best access to public Wi-Fi?  \n",
    "> Does the mix of Wi-Fi types (for example, LinkNYC vs other providers) look similar across boroughs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Wi-Fi access in New York City is not evenly distributed across the five boroughs. Since Manhattan is the economic and tourist center of the city, I expect it to have more public Wi-Fi hotspots per 10,000 residents than the outer boroughs. \n",
    "I also expect the mix of hotspot types (for example, LinkNYC kiosks versus other providers) to differ by borough, with Manhattan relying more heavily on LinkNYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "I work with two datasets from NYC Open Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NYC Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations**  \n",
    "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw/about_data\n",
    "   - Source: NYC Office of Technology and Innovation :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  \n",
    "   - This dataset lists individual public Wi-Fi hotspots across the city, including their **borough**, **location**, and a field indicating the **type or provider** (for example, LinkNYC vs other networks).  \n",
    "   - I use it to count how many hotspots of each type exist in each borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **New York City Population by Borough, 1950–2040**  \n",
    "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-by-Borough-1950-2040/xywu-7bv9/about_data\n",
    "   - Source: NYC Department of City Planning :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \n",
    "   - This dataset provides total population figures for each borough by year, including decennial census counts and projections.  \n",
    "   - I use one recent year of population (for example, 2020) to convert raw hotspot counts into **hotspots per 10,000 residents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both raw datasets are downloaded as CSV files and loaded into pandas in this notebook. All cleaning, merging, and visualization work happens in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the research question, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and clean** the Wi-Fi hotspot dataset, keeping only rows with a valid borough and simplifying the Wi-Fi **type/provider** into a few categories.\n",
    "2. **Aggregate** the Wi-Fi data to get the number of hotspots in each borough, broken down by type.\n",
    "3. **Select** a single recent year of borough populations and join it to the Wi-Fi counts.\n",
    "4. **Compute a derived measure** – the number of hotspots per 10,000 residents for each (borough, Wi-Fi type) combination.\n",
    "5. Create **one main visualization**, a grouped bar chart showing **hotspots per 10,000 residents by borough and Wi-Fi type**, and discuss whether the results match my hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, I start by loading the two CSV files into pandas and taking a quick look at their structure.\n"

    "## Results and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The grouped bar chart shows a clear pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manhattan** has by far the highest number of free public Wi-Fi hotspots per 10,000 residents. Its bar for “Free” Wi-Fi is several times taller than the same bar for the other boroughs.\n",
    "- **Brooklyn and Queens** have moderate levels of free Wi-Fi access per resident, higher than the Bronx and Staten Island but still below Manhattan.\n",
    "- **The Bronx and Staten Island** have the lowest per-capita Wi-Fi access, especially for fully free hotspots. In these boroughs, residents have fewer public Wi-Fi options relative to the size of the population.\n",
    "- Across all boroughs, “Free” hotspots dominate, while “Limited Free” and “Partner Site” hotspots make up a much smaller share. However, the relative height of these smaller bars varies by borough, suggesting some differences in the mix of Wi-Fi types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the data supports my initial idea that public Wi-Fi access is not evenly distributed across New York City. Manhattan stands out as having much better per-capita access, while the Bronx and Staten Island lag behind. This pattern raises questions about digital equity: people in some boroughs have many more opportunities to connect to free public Wi-Fi than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are descriptive rather than causal. The analysis is limited to one population year and to public Wi-Fi hotspots listed in the NYC dataset, and it does not include private home or mobile internet access.
